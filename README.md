# 🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting with AWS SageMaker DeepAR

This project demonstrates how to forecast retail sales using AWS SageMaker's built-in DeepAR algorithm. The goal is to predict future sales using past time series data while also estimating uncertainty with prediction intervals.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Amazon SageMaker**
- **DeepAR algorithm**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **S3** for storage

## 📁 Files Included
- `Deepar_Retail_Forecast_Upgraded.ipynb` – Full notebook with code and clean markdown
- `train_deepar.json` – Sample JSONL training file
- `README.md` – This file

## 🚀 What You'll Learn
- How to prepare time series data in JSON format
- Upload and train DeepAR model on SageMaker
- Deploy and test endpoint with real predictions
- Visualize the forecast using confidence intervals
